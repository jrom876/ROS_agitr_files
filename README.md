# ROS_agitr_files

The EMACS file in this repo contains all .cpp, .launch, CMake.txt, and .xml files which the user must create in "A Gentle Introduction to ROS" using ROS melodic.

Several .pdf files are included including "A Gentle Introduction to ROS."

This is being shared in the hopes that it will be useful and save time for junior ROS developers.

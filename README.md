# ROS_agitr_files

This repo contains all .cpp, .launch, CMake.txt, and .xml files whic I created in " A Gentle Introduction to ROS" using Ros melodic.

Also included is a bash file with custom scripts which I use to create such useful things as a 
Table of Contents, functions and aliases for accessing and editing ROS files.

This is being shared in the hopes that it will be useful and save time for junior ROS developers.

Cheers!!

# ROS_agitr_files

This repo contains all .cpp, .launch, CMake.txt, and .xml files which I created in "A Gentle Introduction to ROS" using ROS melodic.

Several .pdf files are included including "A Gentle Introduction to ROS."

Also included is a bash file (ros.sh) with custom scripts which I use to create such useful things as a 
Table of Contents, functions, and aliases for accessing and editing ROS files.

This is being shared in the hopes that it will be useful and save time for junior ROS developers.
